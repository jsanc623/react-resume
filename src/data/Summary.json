  "I'm a driven senior at Paramus High School, eagerly anticipating graduation this year. I'm passionate about the culinary world and eager to dive into part-time work to gain experience in food service. I'm open to exploring full-time opportunities after graduation.\n\nWith a track record of academic excellence, I've developed strong teamwork skills and maintained a spot on the honor roll throughout my school career. I'm a quick learner, attentive listener, and adept at adapting to new situations. My friendly nature and excellent communication skills make me comfortable handling any challenge. I'm excited about the chance to join the Chick-fil-A team and further develop my skills in the restaurant industry."
